## Project description

This project is a pathfinding algorithm visualizer that allows interactive creation and solving of search 
problems on a 30x40 grid. The user interface includes the following features:
1. Interface elements:
  - Brush: Used to add or remove walls on the grid (left/right click or drag)
  - Carrot and Rabbit: These objects can be placed on the grid as the starting and target points. The rabbit and carrot can be moved by clicking on them and placing them on the desired grid cell.
2. Algorithm Selection:
  - Currently avaible algorithms:
      - DFS (Depth First Search)
      - BFS (Breadth First Search)
      - A*
      - Bidirectional Search
  - After selecting an algorithm and clicking the Find Path button, an animation is displayed, showing how the algorithm explores the grid and finds the target.
  - The visualization highlights the cells added to the algorithmâ€™s data structures and the final path from the start to the target.
3. Control Buttons:
  - Reset: Removes the currently drawn path and resets the grid colors.
  - Clear Walls: Removes all added walls and resets the grid to its initial state.
This project is designed for educational purposes, allowing users to gain a better understanding of various pathfinding algorithms through visual demonstrations of their behavior.
The interface is intuitive, giving users full control over grid creation and algorithm simulation.
